**Ising Model**
The Ising Model is a mathematical model used in statistical mechanics to describe ferromagnetism behavior, and it's used for a great variety of systems; from spin behavior in a lattice, to neurological connections or biological growth. We will be focusing on how the model is used in physics. The Ising Model is defined on a grid (lattice) where each point (site) represents an atomic spin. The most common lattices are 1D (a line of sites), 2D (a square grid), and 3D lattices. Each site can have two possible states: Spin up (+1) or spin down (-1) and they represent the magnetic moment of atoms in a material. In addition, these spins interact with each other, and it leads to the following Hamiltonian:
